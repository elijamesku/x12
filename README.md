Developer-focused ASC X12 healthcare EDI parser, serializer, and builder for Node.js and TypeScript: lenient on parse, spec-clean on emit.

## Why this exists

Reading an X12 healthcare transaction correctly normally means buying the TR3 implementation guide
for it and then hand-mapping element positions that no compiler will ever check. This library
removes that step for the engineer who has one 835 to post, one 271 to answer or one 837 to send,
and who needs the amounts to be exactly right rather than approximately right. The nearest
alternatives are a general-purpose EDI translator, which frames segments correctly but knows nothing
about what CLP-04 means, and a hand-rolled split on the segment terminator, which works until the
first trading partner sends a repetition separator you did not plan for. This is neither: a
zero-dependency TypeScript library that decodes the healthcare transaction sets into typed models,
keeps every amount in exact decimal arithmetic, and reports each vendor deviation it tolerated with
a stable code instead of failing or guessing.

## Status

**Version 0.0.18**, published on npm from a public repository.

On the `0.0.x` ladder the public API is not settled and may still move before `0.1.0`, so pin an
exact version rather than a range. Typed read and typed emit both ship for every transaction set
this package covers: 270, 271, 276, 277 and 277CA, 278 request and response, 820, 834, 835, 837P,
837I and 837D, 999 and TA1, each with a reader and a matching domain builder.
`X12_TR3_CONFORMANCE` is the machine-readable answer to which implementation guide each one
follows, and is a better source than this page.

Not covered, and deliberately so: a byte-exact round trip is not guaranteed in general (see
[Compatibility](#compatibility)), and non-healthcare transaction sets, EDIFACT, transport such as
AS2 and SFTP, and pre-005010 revisions are all out of scope.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @cosyte/x12
```

`npm install @cosyte/x12` and `yarn add @cosyte/x12` work the same way.

Node `>=22.0.0` is the engine floor, and there are zero runtime dependencies. The package ships
dual ESM and CJS builds with type declarations for both conditions, so `import` and `require` each
resolve to the artifact meant for them.

## Usage

Parse an 835 remittance advice and read the money: the payment total, the claim's
charge/paid/patient-responsibility split, and the adjustment reason behind the difference. The
interchange below is synthetic, with a fabricated payer, provider, patient and amounts.

```ts runnable
import { parseX12, get835 } from "@cosyte/x12";

const raw = `ISA*00*          *00*          *ZZ*MEDICARE       *ZZ*SUBMITTER      *260601*1200*^*00501*000000001*0*P*:~

const ix = parseX12(raw);
ix.warnings; // => []

const tx = ix.groups[0]?.transactions.find((t) => t.st.elements[1] === "835");
if (tx === undefined) throw new Error("no 835 in this interchange");
const remit = get835(ix.delimiters, tx);

// The payment header: the money-movement primitive.
remit.payment.totalActualPayment?.toString(); // => "450.00"
remit.payment.creditDebitFlag; // => "C"
remit.payment.method; // => "ACH"
remit.traces[0]?.referenceId; // => "0012345"

// Per claim: your own account number echoed back, and the split.
const claim = remit.claims[0];
claim?.patientControlNumber; // => "PT-ACCT-001"
claim?.totalChargeAmount?.toString(); // => "500.00"
claim?.totalPaymentAmount?.toString(); // => "450.00"
claim?.patientResponsibilityAmount?.toString(); // => "50.00"

// Per service line: who owes the difference, and why.
const adjustment = claim?.serviceLines[0]?.adjustments[0];
adjustment?.groupCode; // => "PR"
adjustment?.reasonCode; // => "1"
adjustment?.reasonDescription; // => "Deductible Amount"
adjustment?.amount?.toString(); // => "50.00"
```

The `groupCode` is what tells you who owes the money (`PR` patient responsibility, `CO` contractual
obligation, and so on). Read it; never infer it.

## PHI and safety

X12 healthcare transactions carry protected health information, so treat every interchange you hand
this library as PHI.

**What it does with your document.** It decodes it in memory and nothing else. No socket is opened,
nothing is written to disk, and nothing is fetched at run time: the bundled code lists are versioned
data snapshots, so updating one is a release rather than a network call. The acknowledgment builders
are pure functions and never auto-send.

**What it keeps out of diagnostics.** A warning `message` is a lookup into a frozen registry rather
than something built from your document, and no warning factory in this library takes a value
parameter, so no element of yours can reach a diagnostic. The code and the `position` say what and
where; the bytes stay on the model. `ALL_WARNING_MESSAGES` is exported so you can assert that.

**The one deliberate exception.** `X12ParseError.snippet` on the four structural fatals is a bounded
copy of the start of the input, so on real traffic it can carry PHI, and it is not redacted. Log
`err.code` and `err.position` instead, or redact at your call site.

**Builder refusals are a weaker surface, deliberately.** A `build*` refusal names the control
number, count or code you passed in, so that you can see what was refused. The rendered fragment is
bounded by an exported constant, but it is bounded rather than redacted. Log `err.code`, not
`err.message`, from a builder.

**What you still own.** Transport, storage, retention, access control, audit logging, and every log
line your own code writes. This library makes no HIPAA compliance claim on your behalf.

## API

Everything ships from one entry point; there are no subpath imports.

- **Read.** `parseX12` decodes an interchange into a model, and a per-transaction reader turns a
  transaction set into a typed one (`get835`, `get837Claims`, `get270Inquiry`, `get271Eligibility`,
  `get276StatusInquiry`, `parse999`, `parseTA1`, and the rest).
- **Emit.** `serializeX12` and `buildInterchange` are the general path, and every transaction set
  with a reader also has a domain builder (`build835`, `build837P`, `build271`, and the rest) that
  layers that guide's own invariants on top.
- **Errors and warnings.** Parsing is lenient, and only **four** structural failures are ever fatal
  (`X12_NO_ISA_HEADER`, `X12_ISA_TOO_SHORT`, `X12_INVALID_DELIMITERS`, `X12_EMPTY_INPUT`).
  Everything else arrives on `ix.warnings` as a stable code with positional context, so a tolerated
  deviation is visible rather than silent.
- **Money.** Every monetary, percent and quantity field decodes as `X12Decimal`, which is
  string-backed with BigInt arithmetic, and this library never **`parseFloat`s** an EDI amount. A
  slot the sender left empty reads `undefined` rather than zero, so "stated zero" and "stated
  nothing" stay different readings.
- **Conformance.** `X12_TR3_CONFORMANCE` states which implementation guide each transaction set
  follows and how that identifier stands against the federal incorporation by reference.

Task-oriented recipes are in the [cookbook](./docs-content/cookbook.md), and
[KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md](./KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) is the honest do-not-over-trust list.

### Dates and times

Every typed reader surfaces its dates verbatim, as the qualifier the sender used plus the bytes it
carried. `toObject`, `toISO` and `toDate` are the three ways to read one, and every `@cosyte/*`
parser exports the same three names with the same shapes and the same timezone rule.

```ts
import { toObject, toISO, toDate } from "@cosyte/x12";

// A DTP or DTM date off any typed reader: claim.dates[0], eligibility.dates[0], and so on.
const day = { formatQualifier: "D8", value: "20260601" };

toObject(day); // { year: 2026, month: 6, day: 1 }
toISO(day); // "2026-06-01"

// A calendar day is not an instant. Without a stated offset there is no answer.
toDate(day); // undefined
toDate(day, { assumeOffsetMinutes: 0 })?.toISOString(); // "2026-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"
toDate(day, { assumeOffsetMinutes: -300 })?.toISOString(); // "2026-06-01T05:00:00.000Z"

// A range converts to nothing, because an interval is not a point in time.
const span = { formatQualifier: "RD8", value: "20260601-20260605" };
toISO(span); // undefined
```

**The decoded format qualifier set is `D8` and `RD8`, and nothing else.** Those are the two DTP-02
values this library already parses and builds: `D8` is a single `CCYYMMDD` day, and `RD8` is a
`CCYYMMDD-CCYYMMDD` range. A qualifier outside that pair, an absent one, a value whose digits do not
match the shape its qualifier declares, and a day that is not on the calendar all convert to
`undefined`. None of the three ever throws, so a lenient parse stays lenient all the way to the
value you read.

**`RD8` converts to `undefined` from all three, deliberately.** An interval is not a point in time,
so there is no single day to hand back for a service period or an eligibility span. Handing back the
first endpoint would be a quiet wrong answer with a right-looking shape. Split the range yourself
and convert whichever end you meant.

**`toDate` returns an instant only when you state the zone.** No X12 date element this library
decodes carries a UTC offset, so `assumeOffsetMinutes` (signed minutes east of UTC) is the only way
one reaches the result. Without it the answer is `undefined`: the host machine's timezone is never
read and UTC is never assumed, because the same midnight is two different instants either side of a
border and a date of birth read in the wrong zone is a day out.

`toObject` returns only the components the value stated, with `month` spec-native 1 to 12 rather
than the JavaScript `Date` 0 to 11, so `Object.keys()` of the result tells you the precision. Delete
`offsetMinutes` and what is left is accepted by `Temporal.PlainDateTime.from` and by luxon's
`DateTime.fromObject` with no renaming. Neither library is a dependency here; this package still has
zero of those.

`parseDocumentDate`, which reads the document date for the date-aware code-list queries, keeps its
own contract and still THROWS on input it refuses. That divergence is deliberate: it answers a
caller who asked a validity question and could not state the day, while these three read a document
that was already parsed leniently.

#### Using two @cosyte parsers in one file

The three names are identical in every `@cosyte/*` parser, so importing two of them means aliasing:

```ts
import { toISO as x12ToISO } from "@cosyte/x12";
import { toISO as hl7ToISO } from "@cosyte/hl7";

x12ToISO({ formatQualifier: "D8", value: "20260601" });
hl7ToISO(someParsedHl7Timestamp);
```

A namespace import works too: `import * as x12 from "@cosyte/x12"`, then `x12.toISO(day)`.

## Compatibility

- **005010 HIPAA transaction sets**, with hooks for the errata revisions the industry actually
  exchanges. Non-healthcare sets such as 850, 856, 810 and 204, plus EDIFACT, AS2 and SFTP
  transport, and pre-005010 revisions, are out of scope.
- **Vendor deviations become warnings, not exceptions.** Built-in profiles record whose
  companion-guide deviation they accommodate; selecting one never changes an otherwise correct
  parse, and profiles are authored through the same public `defineProfile()` API you have.
- **Round trips are not byte-exact in general.** `serializeX12` reproduces the segments on the model
  verbatim, including element padding, composites and `?`-release escapes, but
  **`serialize(parse(s)) === s` is not guaranteed in general**. Line breaks between segments are the
  common case: any run of CR or LF between segments is absorbed at parse, so a pretty-printed file
  emits compact. Most of the constructs that break a round trip are silent, so "my file has no line
  breaks" is not sufficient either. [KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md](./KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) is the canonical
  list.

## Contributing

Questions, bug reports and trading-partner quirks all belong in
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/cosyte/x12/issues).

Pull requests are welcome. A contribution must clear `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test`,
hold the per-directory coverage floors, pass the PHI commit gate (`pnpm phi-scan`) and the prose
gates (`pnpm check:no-emdash`, `pnpm check:no-internal-refs`), and carry a changeset. Every fixture
must be synthetic: never open a pull request carrying a real patient's data.
